# Be a Part of Something Bigger

### This project is supported by many people from all over the world. Even if you're not a programmer, you can get involved and make a difference.

- Help me make the experience even better by translating my scripts and other files into more languages.
- It would be good for me if you could help other people with problems and questions.
- Help me with the creation of the documentation.
- Help out by tracking down issues and reporting them. Or help by confirming, clarifying, and cleaning up existing issues.
